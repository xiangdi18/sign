def jpgmaker():
    """

Purpose: The jpgmaker function converts each page of a PDF document into a JPEG image and saves these images to the specified directory. It returns the total number of pages processed and the paths to the saved images.

Args:

pdf_document: A PDF document object from which pages are to be extracted.

filename (str): The base name to use for the saved image files.

Returns:

int: The total number of pages in the PDF document.

list: A list of file paths where the images are saved.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Image Paths List**:
   - Initialize an empty list `image_paths` to store the paths to the saved images.

2. **Iterate Through PDF Pages**:
   - Loop through each page of the `pdf_document` using a `for` loop.
   - For each page, generate a pixmap using `pdf_document.load_page(page_num).get_pixmap()`.
   - Convert the pixmap to an image using `Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes()))`.

3. **Save Each Page as JPEG**:
   - Construct the image file path using the provided `filename` and the current page number.
   - Save the image as a JPEG file at the constructed path.
   - Append the image path to the `image_paths` list.

4. **Return Total Pages and Image Paths**:
   - Return the total number of pages in the PDF document and the list of image paths.

def find_signature():
    """
Purpose: The find_signature function detects and compares a signature within a given image against a reference signature image using a series of image processing and feature extraction steps. If a match is found, it returns the matched signature region; otherwise, it returns None.

Args:

file_path (str): Path to the main image file containing the signature to be detected.

reference_signature_path (str): Path to the reference signature image file.

Returns:

numpy.ndarray or None: The region of the main image where the signature is found. Returns None if no match is found.

### Steps:
1. **Detect Signature Area**:
   - Use the `template_matching` function to detect the signature area in the main image.
   - If no signature area is detected, return `None`.

2. **Preprocess Detected Signature Area**:
   - Convert the detected signature area to a suitable format using the `preprocess_image` function.

3. **Preprocess Reference Signature**:
   - Load the reference signature image and convert it to grayscale using `cv2.imread(reference_signature_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)`.
   - Preprocess the reference signature using the `preprocess_image` function.

4. **Extract Features**:
   - Extract features from both the detected signature area and the reference signature using the `extract_features` function.

5. **Calculate Similarity**:
   - Compute the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of the detected signature and the reference signature using the `cosine_similarity` function.

6. **Display Results**:
   - Display the similarity score and images of the detected and reference signatures using `st.write` and `st.image`.
   - Provide an explanation of the similarity score.

7. **Return Signature
    - If a match is found, return the region of the main image where the signature is detected. Otherwise, return `None`.
