Documentation for jpgmaker Function
Purpose: The jpgmaker function converts each page of a PDF document into a JPEG image and saves these images to the specified directory. It returns the total number of pages processed and the paths to the saved images.

Args:

pdf_document: A PDF document object from which pages are to be extracted.

filename (str): The base name to use for the saved image files.

Returns:

int: The total number of pages in the PDF document.

list: A list of file paths where the images are saved.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Image Paths List**:
   - Initialize an empty list `image_paths` to store the paths to the saved images.

2. **Iterate Through PDF Pages**:
   - Loop through each page of the `pdf_document` using a `for` loop.
   - For each page, generate a pixmap using `pdf_document.load_page(page_num).get_pixmap()`.
   - Convert the pixmap to an image using `Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes()))`.

3. **Save Each Page as JPEG**:
   - Construct the image file path using the provided `filename` and the current page number.
   - Save the image as a JPEG file at the constructed path.
   - Append the image path to the `image_paths` list.

4. **Return Total Pages and Image Paths**:
   - Return the total number of pages in the PDF document and the list of image paths.
